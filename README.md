# Fake News Detector

![image1](image1)

## Overview

Fake News Detector is a machine learning project designed to automatically classify news articles as real or fake. This project leverages deep learning methods, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to analyze text data and assess the authenticity of news.

## What You Will Learn

- Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, perform tokenization and padding.
- Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM.
- Train deep learning models and assess their performance.

## Skills Gained

- Data Cleansing
- Deep Learning
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Tensorflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Analysis
- Natural Language Processing
- Data Manipulation
- Matplotlib
- Plotting (Graphics)
- Data Processing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaidaanshiraz/Fake_News_Detector.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (update as necessary for your project):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of news articles (CSV or text format).
2. Run the main script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Review the output to see predictions and performance metrics.
